Assignment 5 :  
- Heap Sort

Background:

As we have seen, the heap is a data structure with a very special feature of always positing the priority element at the top of the heap. Because of the order property of heaps, we can take advantage of this situation by using a heap to help us sort.  Additionally Heap Sort is one of the best sorting methods being in-place and with no quadratic worst-case scenarios.

Objective:

Design and implement a heap sort solution that sorts the items in an array into ascending order.

Requirements:

Define a heap and develop a set of operations for creating and manipulating a heap that satisfies a heap sort implementation.

Test Run Requirements: Provide a copy of your run of the test driver shown below to trace the heap sort as it sorts the following arrays into ascending order.  Use multi-line comment delimiters to encase your run so that your solution will compile in the grader test bed.
